A ruby implementation of Roger Alsing's "Mona Lisa evolution program":http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/, using JRuby. At this stage, this is pretty much a line-by-line copy of Roger Alsing's original implementation (aside from a few Java-isms for displaying the output), minus the user-friendly interface; I mainly used the conversion to understand how the original works, but unfortunately I didn't really add that much new in the process.

The script accepts up to two arguments: a path to a source image (the default Mona Lisa image is used if none is provided), and whether or not to save the output in the "dumps" folder (yes if the second argument is "savedumps", otherwise no).
